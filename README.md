# team-wrap-around  
## The Game Plan -- to-do List 
0. Preliminary action items(things to do before we get into implementing any actual methods): 
  * Decide on a specific object to use(before implementing generic typing at the end): We have decided on Strings! 
  * Decide between choosing a (doubly-linked) node-based, array-based, or ArrayList-based architecture to implement a deque: we have decided on using a doubly-linked node-based structure. 
  * Create a deque class with (nearly) empty implementations of the interface for deque to check if class will compile
1. Implement the following core methods:  
  * addFirst(Object)  
  * addLast(Object)
  * removeFirst()
  * removeLast()
  * size()
  * getFirst()  
  * getLast()
2. Implement wrappers for other methods by using core functionality:  
  * add(Object)
  * remove()
  * peek()
  * peekFirst() 
  * peekLast()
  * element()
  * offer(Object)
  * offerFirst(Object)
  * offerLast(Object)
  * poll()
  * pollFirst() 
  * pollLast()
  * pop()
  * push(Object) 
3. Implement extra functionality Methods:
  * contains(Object)
  * descendingIterator()
  * iterator()
  * remove(Object)
  * removeFirstOccurence(Object)
  * removeLastOccurence(Object)
4. Implement extra functionality: 
  * Generic Typing
  * Exception Handlding
